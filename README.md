# Machine-Learning: In the first upload, I have done Explaratory Data Analysis(EDA) on the Dataset "Insurance.csv"
The Second Upload is about EDA on the "Bank Churn Data set" Model
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in data analysis. It helps in understanding the data, identifying patterns, and detecting anomalies. Here are the steps to perform EDA on a dataset:

Get familiar with the data: Start by reading the data and understanding the columns, the type of data, and the number of rows. Check if there are any missing values, and if so, how many.

Identify the target variable: Determine the outcome variable or target variable, which will be used to build the model.

Univariate analysis: Examine each feature in isolation. For continuous features, plot a histogram and a box plot to understand the distribution, central tendency, and spread. For categorical features, plot a bar graph to understand the frequency distribution.

Bivariate analysis: Analyze the relationship between the target variable and each of the independent variables. For continuous features, use a scatter plot, and for categorical features, use a stacked bar graph or box plots.

Missing values: If there are any missing values, determine how to handle them. You may either impute the missing values, delete the observations with missing values, or use a model that can handle missing values.

Outliers: Identify and analyze outliers. Outliers can impact the results of the analysis, so it is important to determine if they are genuine or erroneous.

Correlation analysis: Examine the correlation between features. Calculate the correlation coefficient, and plot a correlation matrix to identify the strength and direction of the correlation between features.

Data transformation: If the data is not normally distributed, consider applying a transformation, such as log transformation or Box-Cox transformation, to make the distribution normal.

Dimensionality reduction: If the dataset has too many features, use dimensionality reduction techniques, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), to reduce the number of features.

Visualizations: Use various visualizations such as scatter plots, heatmaps, and pair plots to better understand the data.

Overall, EDA is an iterative process, and it may be necessary to revisit some steps depending on the findings.
